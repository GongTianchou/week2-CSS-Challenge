                <P>I was primarily interested in Mathematics, Statistics, and Business when I started studying Actuarial Science at Temple University. My vocabulary did not include the word "Technology." To my surprise, I found myself more in favor of computer science after I stepped into the workplace in 2016. Coding was a valuable tool for me at first, to structure datasets and generate reports. Then, as I learned more, it became a transformative discipline that fed into my curiosity for new technologies and my passion for life.

                <P>My coding practice came in handy at work. In 2020, I joined the Greenery Apartment. As a fluent bilingual speaker in both English and Mandarin, I assisted the front-end web developers in creating a Chinese version of our website and used my JavaScript knowledge to modify the web page structure to make it more readable in Chinese. I help to reach new customers by developing a marketing campaign plan based on machine learning models. I could use machine learning algorithms to tag my existing clients, categorize them, and use a linear support vector machine in Python to find similarities in them, allowing me to identify the attributes of my potential clients. It is incredible how a few lines of code can sort a massive amount of data all at once. In addition, figuring out how to make the algorithm more efficient and run in less time pushed me to learn more. After studying various models, I believe that artificial intelligence will eventually replace labor work, freeing us from our daily responsibilities and allowing us to be more creative.
